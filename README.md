## Indian cyberguard
In the current digital landscape, the rising incidence of cybercrimes underscores the necessity for efficient tools that assist citizens in accurately reporting incidents. This project aimed to develop a Natural Language Processing (NLP) model to enhance the filing process on the National Cyber Crime Reporting Portal (NCRP). The model analyses textual descriptions and accompanying media to classify incidents into appropriate categories and subcategories. By utilising datasets that detail various cybercrimes, including "Online Financial Fraud" and "Online and Social Media Related Crime," we employed preprocessing techniques such as tokenization, lemmatization, and case normalisation to standardise the data. We compared baseline models like logistic regression and Naive Bayes with more advanced transformer-based architectures, including BERT and RoBERTa, to identify the top-performing model. This report outlines the systematic approach taken, from preprocessing through model evaluation and deployment strategies.
